 Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in Photonics: Training a Beam Splitter
This repository hosts an educational project that demonstrates a fundamental application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in the field of quantum photonics. It showcases how a variational quantum circuit (VQC) can be trained to accurately mimic the behavior of a photonic beam splitter using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization approach.

This project was developed as a hands-on teaching example to help students and enthusiasts grasp core QML concepts and their relevance to real-world quantum systems.

 Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to:

Illustrate the concept of Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs).
Showcase how classical optimizers can be used to train quantum circuits.
Provide a concrete example of QML applied to a physical system (a photonic beam splitter).
Serve as an accessible educational resource for those beginning their journey in QML and quantum optics.
 What the Project Does
The project consists of a Python script that performs the following steps:

Defines an "Ideal" Quantum Beam Splitter: A simple Pennylane quantum circuit simulates an ideal beam splitter using a single RY (Y-rotation) gate. The rotation angle (theta) controls the splitting ratio of a photon between two paths (represented by qubit states ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩).
Generates Training Data: Probabilistic outputs from this ideal beam splitter are collected across various theta values to form the training dataset.
Builds a QML Model: A second variational quantum circuit is defined with trainable parameters (weights). This model's goal is to learn the input-output relationship of the ideal beam splitter.
Trains the Model: A classical Gradient Descent optimizer is used to iteratively adjust the model's weights, minimizing a Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function between the model's predictions and the "real data."
Visualizes Results: After training, the project plots the predicted probabilities from the trained QML model against the ideal beam splitter's probabilities, demonstrating the learning success.

Interpretation of the Plot: Training Success!

This plot visualizes the core result of your Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model's training process.

X-axis: "Theta"
This represents the input parameter θ (ranging from 0 to approximately π or 3.14). In the context of your beam splitter simulation, θ controls the splitting ratio.
Y-axis: "Probability of ∣1⟩"
This represents the probability of measuring the qubit in the ∣1⟩ state. For an ideal RY(theta) gate, this probability is sin2(θ/2), ranging from 0 to 1.
Data Series:

Blue Dots: "Real Data"
These points represent the target data or "ground truth" generated by your ideal quantum circuit (simulating the perfect beam splitter). They follow the sin2(θ/2) curve.
Red Line: "Model Prediction"
This line represents the predictions of your trained Quantum Machine Learning model. It shows the output of your quantum_model using the optimized weights for each theta value.
Overall Interpretation:

The plot clearly shows that the red line (Model Prediction) closely overlaps with the blue dots (Real Data). This strong alignment indicates that the training process was highly successful.

Successful Learning: Your QML model has effectively learned and mimicked the input-output relationship of the ideal photonic beam splitter.
Cost Function Minimization: This result implies that the classical optimizer (Gradient Descent) successfully minimized the cost function (Mean Squared Error), adjusting the model's weights until its predictions closely matched the target probabilities.
